# VOSS CPP Loop Trace

## Overview
This Python script is designed to help VOSS users locate the sources of excessive traffic to the control plane in a network environment on a VOSS VSP. The script leverages the built-in `trace` tool on VOSS to analyze traffic patterns and pinpoint potential issues.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Network access to the VOSS VSP (if using the script to log in remotely).
- Appropriate credentials for accessing the VSP.

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download and save the script to a directory on your system.

## Usage
1. Run the script using Python 3.
   ```bash
   python3 VOSSLoopTrace.py

## Usage
The script will prompt you for input. You have two options:
- **Provide a Trace File**: If you already have a trace file generated by the VOSS `trace` tool, you can place a file named 'loop.txt' in the running directory.
- **Remote Login to VSP**: If you do not have a trace file, the script can log in to the VSP remotely to generate and analyze trace data. You will be prompted to enter the IP address, username, and password for the VSP.

## Features
- **Trace File Analysis**: Analyzes existing trace files to identify sources of excessive traffic to the control plane.
- **Remote Data Collection**: Remotely logs into the VSP to generate and analyze trace data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use prompts guide you through the process of analyzing the network traffic.

## Note
- This tool is intended for use by network professionals familiar with VOSS.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access and analyze network data.
