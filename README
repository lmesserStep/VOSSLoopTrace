Control Plane Traffic Analyzer
Overview
This Python script is designed to help network administrators identify the sources of excessive traffic to the control plane in a network environment using VOSS (Virtual Services Platform). The script leverages the built-in trace tool on VOSS to analyze traffic patterns and pinpoint potential issues.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Network access to the VOSS VSP (if using the script to log in remotely).
Appropriate credentials for accessing the VSP.
Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.
Download and save the script to a directory on your system.
Usage
Run the script using Python 3.
Copy code
python3 control_plane_traffic_analyzer.py
The script will prompt you for input. You have two options:
Provide a Trace File: If you already have a trace file generated by the VOSS trace tool, you can input the path to this file when prompted.
Remote Login to VSP: If you do not have a trace file, the script can log in to the VSP remotely to generate and analyze trace data. You will be prompted to enter the IP address, username, and password for the VSP.
Features
Trace File Analysis: Analyzes existing trace files to identify sources of excessive traffic to the control plane.
Remote Data Collection: Remotely logs into the VSP to generate and analyze trace data.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use prompts guide you through the process of analyzing the network traffic.
Note
This tool is intended for use by network professionals familiar with VOSS and VSP.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access and analyze network data.
